### Hey, I'm Sashini Liyanage ðŸ‘‹

I completed my Computer Engineering degree with First Class Honours from the University of Peradeniya and currently serve as a Research Assistant at the Multidisciplinary AI Research Center at the same university. :student:

My research interests lie in signal processing and artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning and computer vision, with wearables, focusing on but not limited to biomedical engineering applications.
